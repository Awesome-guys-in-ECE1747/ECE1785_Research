### Background
Nowadays, software engineers are playing an important role in the industry, so the coding efficiency of them is of vital significance to the companies. In order to decide which factors have a great impact on the coding efficiency, many companies have done surveys in this area. And they have adapted the working environment according to the results. However, as far as I am concerned, the surveys pay more attention to the external factors like gender, age, family status, instead of internal factors like emotions. As is widely acknowledged, emotions can be a catalyst to the work. Many researches have existed concerning emotion mining alone, but no research has connected the relationship between coding efficiency and emotions. So we expect to mine out the relationship between them, in a gesture to attract more attention to the psychological health of software engineers.

 

### Research Questions

How do we define and categorize emotions?

How do we know the emotions from the code?

How do we measure the efficiency of coding?

Does the emotion change have impact on the efficiency of coding?



### Methodology

Some plans considered:

1. Find out some open-source code repositories, get the commit log of them and analyze the emotions contained in the commit messages. Calculate the number of lines every contributors commit in a certain period of time. Compare the efficiency in different emotions.
2. Do some interviews in the peers about the emotions. Ask the participants to make a record of their moods every time they start to work, and calculate their coding efficiency.

I think these methods are appropriate in three ways:

1. As a student, we don't have enough time and money to do interviews on a large amount of people. These methods can help us get the original data quickly and easily.
2. The existing emotional mining and NLP technology is well developed, I think we can mine out enough information from the commit messages. \
3. The working efficiency is hard to define, so we can only count on the coding lines to measure it. 

### Expected Results 

We should mine out the relationship between emotions and coding efficiency. We should quantitively analyze the results to find out how much difference will be between different emotions. We can contribute to the industry for that we make it clear the psychological health of programmers can influence the coding efficiency greatly.
