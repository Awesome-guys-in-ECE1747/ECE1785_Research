%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  This report mainly discussed the impacts of different emotions may have on coding efficiency. We use both quantitative and qualitative analysis to find the results. For the quantitative analysis, we investigate the open-source repositories, mine the emotion hidden inside the commit messages and find the relationship between emotion and coding efficiency. For the qualitative analysis, we make some interviews with software engineers from dot-com companies, research teams and open-source community. Besides, some participants also shared their project emotional experience on other engineer-related approaches, which indicates some general clues of emotion impacts in computer engineering.

\section{Introduction}
Brief introduction of the research topic, including the background information, the motivation and contribution of our research.

\section{Literature Review}
Detailed information of definition of emotions, categorization and emotional mining.\\
Major references are:\cite{c.elmohamed},\cite{ekman1999basic},\cite{wikiemotion},\cite{10.1115/1.4047685},\cite{shaver1987emotion},\cite{5693422},\cite{barsade2007does},\cite{pervez2010impact},\cite{coviello2020effect},\cite{kadoya2020emotional}.
\subsection{Definition \& Categories of Emotions}
The definition and features of emotions from a psychological aspect. Using a consistent categorization standard to analyze the emotions. Explain the categories and the words which belongs to these emotions.
In this part, we will discuss definition from wikipedia\cite{wikiemotion}, the Ekman emotion framework\cite{ekman1999basic}.
\subsection{Emotion and productivity}
In this part we will discuss how does emotion affect productivity. 
The papers are \cite{kadoya2020emotional},\cite{coviello2020effect},\cite{pervez2010impact},\cite{barsade2007does},\cite{shaver1987emotion}
\subsection{Emotional Mining}
Introduce the emotional mining methods used in github. The papers discussed in this part are \cite{5693422},\cite{10.1115/1.4047685},\cite{c.elmohamed}.

\section{Research Questions}

%TODO: More discussions, maybe we need a grounded theory?
There are a number of research questions we plan to figure out through the research.
\begin{itemize}
  \item How do we define and categorize different kinds of emotion?
  \item How do we know engineers’ emotion from their codes?
  \item How do we measure the efficiency of coding?
  \item Does the emotion change have impact on the efficiency of coding?
  \item What effects will the emotion change cause on coding efficiency?
\end{itemize}


\section{Methodology}
We will collect and analyze our data in both qualitative and quantitative ways.
\subsection{Study 1: Emotional Mining}
%TODO
%We will use the emotional mining methods to mine the emotions in the selected repositories which are easy to analyze.
%Then we will calculate the coding efficiency of each mined commit messages accordingly.
\subsection{Study 2: Semi-structured Interview}
We design a semi-structured interview to do qualitative study to explore the relationship between emotion impacts and coding efficiency on the subjective perspective. Besides, we also tried to figure out the potential factors which influence the emotional status of people during the project in order to give suggestions with reference values to both employers and team leaders.
