%1) decide what your purpose is and write a sentence describing it.
%2) develop an interview protocol. The protocol can be short, focusing on exactly what you are interested in. You should anticipate short interviews, perhaps 15-20 minutes at most.
%3) conduct two interviews.
%4) be prepared to tell the class what you learned, how the interviews went, any problems or lessons you can share. In future classes, we will learn more structured ways of analyzing qualitative data such as interview transcripts.

\section{Introduction \& Motivation}
As part of our final project, I have been doing interviews with many software engineers in big companies.
To my surprise, many of them have contributed or are making contributions to the open-source projects. 
So I'm curious about what's the big companies attitude towards these open-source projects related experience.\par 
Do we need to make more contributions to open-source projects if we want to apply for some companies which flavor open-source communities? 
Does age have an impact within? Does young people have to contribute more to open-source code to get their jobs?
Will the employers ask us to contribute to open-source communities as our job if they encourage using/contributing to open-source projects?
I think this problem matters because it can help me and many other software engineering students 
have a clearer view of this aspect before we try to seek for jobs. Hopefully, \cite{GitHubOpenSourceSurvey2017}\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Geiger17} has mentioned part of these questions and data, so this report will explore these questions.


\section{Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1: Do young people have to contribute more to open-source projects to get their position in companies which flavor open-source communities?\par
    \item RQ2: Do employees tend to contribute to open-source projects as their job in companies which encourage using to open-source projects?
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Cleaning \& Analysis}
This is the dataset\cite{GitHubOpenSourceDataset2017}\. I used 'Python' to do the data cleaning and analysis.
To do the data cleaning, I use the 'pandas' lib: the read\_csv function to read the data and dropna function to drop the rows which has a NaN data.\par
For the first question, I choose the 'AGE' column to represent the age and working experience of the engineers, the 'EMPLOYER.POLICY.APPLICATIONS' column to show whether the companies flavor the open-source communities and the 'OSS.HIRING' column to explore if the experience helps them get their jobs.\par
For the second question, I choose the 'OSS.AS.JOB' column to represent whether they tend to contribute to open-source projects as their job, 'EMPLOYER.POLICY.APPLICATIONS' column to show their employers attitude towards open-source communities.
In order for the data to fit into the linear regression model, I transformed the data into numbers. You can find the code in the appendix.\par
'OSS.HIRING': 'Very important':1,'Somewhat important':2,'Not at all important':3,'Not too important':4,'Not applicable-I hadn\'t made any contributions when I got this job.':5\par
'AGE': '17 or younger':1,'18 to 24 years':2,'25 to 34 years':3,'35 to 44 years':4,'45 to 54 years':5,'55 to 64 years':6,'65 years or older':7\par
'EMPLOYER.POLICY.APPLICATIONS':'Use of open source applications is encouraged.':1,'Use of open source applications is acceptable if it is the most appropriate tool.':2,'My employer doesn\'t have a clear policy on this.':3,'Not applicable':4,'I\'m not sure.':5,'Use of open source applications is rarely, if ever, permitted.':6\par
'OSS.AS.JOB'='Yes, directly-  some or all of my work duties include contributing to open source projects.':1,'Yes, indirectly- I contribute to open source in carrying out my work duties, but I am not required or expected to do so.':2,'No.':3
    
\section{Results}
\subsection{RQ1}
The formula is $y=0.04301915x_{1}+0.23456672x_{2}+c$ where $y$ is the predicted 'OSS.HIRING', $x_{1}$ is 'AGE', $x_{2}$ is 'EMPLOYER.POLICY.APPLICATIONS', c is a constant number.

    \end{table}
As is shown above, the less your companies show positive attitude to open-source communities, the older you are, your open-source experience is less likely to help you get the job.
Controlling the age $x_{1}$ to be the same, we can see that $y$ is increasing with $x_{2}$. It means the companies which do not like open-source projects pay less attention to the related working experience when hiring engineers.
Controlling the policy $x_{2}$ to be the same, we can see that $y$ is increasing with $x_{1}$. It means the older you are, the open-source projects will help you less to get your job.
\subsection{RQ2}
    The formula is $y=0.20563629x+c$ where $y$ is the predicted 'OSS.AS.JOB', $x$ is 'EMPLOYER.POLICY.APPLICATIONS',c is a constant number.
[[0.20563629]]
\begin{table}[]
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
 x & y                  \\ \hline
 1  & 1.9315087682434604  \\ \hline
 2  & 2.1371450584278575 \\ \hline
 3  & 2.342781348612254   \\ \hline
 4  & 2.5484176387966513 \\ \hline

 6  & 2.959690219165445 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

 The result shows that if your company has a positive attitude to open-source projects, you are more likely to contribute to open-source project as your paid job or part of it.
\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, if we want to enter a company, it helps a lot to know whether this company flavors the open-source projects. If it does, we should contribute more to the open-source projects which can help us greatly in the application.
And as young students, we should do more open-source contributions for our future jobs.
What's more, in companies which have a positive attitude towards open-source projects, we are more likely to contribute to open-source projects as our job.

% \begin{abstract}
% Three dimensional images were obtained using a single high numerical aperture hologram recorded in a high resolution photoresist with a table top $\alpha = 46.9$ nm laser. Gabor holograms numerically reconstructed over a range of image planes by sweeping the propagation distance allow numerical optical sectioning that results in a robust three dimension image of a test object with a resolution in depth of approximately and a lateral resolution of 164 nm.
